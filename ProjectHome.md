# Electronic Tagging Geolocation Packages Repository #

This site provides a collection of statistical models to estimate position errors, movement model parameters, and most probable positions from tracking data. This project is a joint effort from **[Pelagic Fisheries Research Program (PFRP)](http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/PFRP/)** of Joint Institute for Marine & Atmospheric Research, University of Hawaii at Manoa and **[Large Pelagics Research Center (LPRC)](http://tunalab.org)** of University of Massachusetts, Amherst.
